## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Monte Thakkar.

I'm a full-stack senior software engineer with 8 years of experience and currently working at an AI startup where I've helped scale the business to $1M ARR. I am proficient in using LLMs, ReactJS, NextJS, React Native, Typescript, TailwindCSS and PostgresDB. I also have a strong product sense building 0-1 products at multiple startups. 

Key achievements include architecting cross-platform subscription infrastructure processing $100K monthly revenue, building push notification delivery system processing 20K+ daily with 11% open rate through LLM personalization, and maintaining an open-source project with 400K+ monthly downloads. I have a growth mindset and am always seeking feedback.
